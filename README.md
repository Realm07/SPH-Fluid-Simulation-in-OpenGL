# Please Note:
When running the application, windows will prompt it as untrusted and malicious. That is because my code isn't signed. To get it signed I'll need to pay ~350$ an year. **The code is clean.** You can view it in the repository under `src/`. Alternatively you can build and compile it yourself.
